## Microsoft SQL Server Developer Edition

For Windows, download the latest version of [MSSQL Server Developer edition](https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/sql-server/sql-server-downloads). This is free software and requires no registration.

Execute the SQL2019-SSEI-Dev.exe, choose Download Media at a specified location 

Use ISO packaging, mount and install 

After checking your computer, make full installation, select all options and proceed using default settings 

Add current user in all cases 

For authentication, choose *mixed mode authentication* (it may be shown as *SQL Server and Windows Authentication mode*). If you are asked for a user name, use **sa**, and for the password use **passw0rd** (we will only use publicly available sample data for the project so we are ok with basic security) 

## SQL Server Management Studio
