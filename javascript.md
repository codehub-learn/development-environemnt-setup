## Code editor 

Feel free to use any IDE you like. **However, [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is the recommended IDE** since it is light-weight, has a tone of extensions/plugins, and it is an industry standard. 

VS Code will be used within class.

## Other tools
1. Git, download and install **[Git Version Control](https://git-scm.com/downloads)**
2. Create a **[Github account](https://github.com/join)**
