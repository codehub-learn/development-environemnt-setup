# Software requirements for Java Standard Edition

## Development IDE
**[Download IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=windows)** and install. In case you already have it installed and your license has expired, we will provide you a valid license for the duration of the course. In case you prefer using another IDE, that's also fine as the examples do not make use of any IDE specific functionality. 

## Java Development Tools
1. Download the .exe file and install the latest LTS version of **[Liberica JDK 17 LTS](https://bell-sw.com/pages/downloads/)**. Then create an environmental variable named **JAVA_HOME** pointing to JDK installation folder.
2. Download **[Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)** and follow the **[instructions](https://maven.apache.org/install.html)**. Through Maven dependency management mechanism, we will download every library needed in our projects.  Create then an environmental variable named **MVN_HOME** pointing to Maven's installation folder.
3. Add **%JAVA_HOME%\bin** and **%MVN_HOME%\bin** to your **PATH** envrionmental variable.

## Database
1. Please follow **[the instructions here](https://github.com/codehub-learn/development-environment-setup/blob/main/MSSQL.md)** to install Microsoft SQL Server.

## Other tools
1. Download and install **[Git Version Control](https://git-scm.com/downloads)**.
2. Create a **[Github account](https://github.com/join)**.
