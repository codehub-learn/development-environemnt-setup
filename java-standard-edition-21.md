# Hardware and software requirements for Java Standard Edition development (Java SE 21)
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

## Workstation specifications
- Windows 10 or Linux or MacOS, 64 bit
- RAM, 8GB required, 16GB preferable
- 128 GB Storage (SSD would be preferrable)
- 4 Core CPU

## Development IDE
IntelliJ IDEA Community edition or Ultimate edition are both suitable as tools. If you do not have any of these already installed, download
**[IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=windows)** and install. For the Ultimate Edition, in case you already have a license the you are already set up, else we will provide you a valid license for the duration of the course. In case you prefer using another IDE, that's also fine as the examples do not make use of any IDE specific functionality. Support, however, can only be provided for IntelliJ.

## Java Development Tools
1. Java Development Toolkit, download and install the Java LTS version 21 from this location **[JDK 21 downloads](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/)**. Create then an environmental variable named **JAVA_HOME** pointing to JDK installation folder.

3. Add **%JAVA_HOME%\bin** and **%MVN_HOME%\bin** to your **PATH** envrionmental variable.

## Other tools
1. Download and install **[Git Version Control](https://git-scm.com/downloads)**. If you have an older version of git, it is recommended that you update to the latest version.
2. Create a **[Github account](https://github.com/join)** if you don't already have one (it is free).
