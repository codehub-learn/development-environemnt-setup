&nbsp;
&nbsp;

## Workstation specifications
- Windows 10/11 or Linux or MacOS, 64 bit
- Minimum of 8GB RAM, 16GB preferable
- Minimum of 128 GB Storage (SSD would be preferrable)
- Minimum of 2-Core CPU

## Development IDE
Download and install the latest version of **[IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=windows)**. The Ultimate version is acceptable too, but its features work for 1 month before a paid licence is required.

## Java Development Tools
1. Java Development Toolkit: download and install Java 11 **[JDK 11](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk11-archive-downloads.html#license-lightbox)** (requires free account with Oracle). If you have Java 17 already installed, you do not need to install Java 11; use Java 17 instead.
2. Create an environmental variable named **JAVA_HOME** pointing to JDK installation folder. Also add **%JAVA_HOME%/bin** and **%MVN_HOME%/bin** to your **PATH** envrionmental variable.
