## Development IDE
**[Download IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=windows)** and install. If you do not have a licence available, Code.Hub will provide you with one for the duration of the course. 

## Java Development Tools
1. Java Development Toolkit: download and install Java 11 **[JDK 11](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk11-archive-downloads.html#license-lightbox)** (requires free account with Oracle). If you have Java 17 already installed, you do not need to install Java 11; use Java 17 instead.
2. Create an environmental variable named **JAVA_HOME** pointing to JDK installation folder. Also add **%JAVA_HOME%/bin** and **%MVN_HOME%/bin** to your **PATH** envrionmental variable.
