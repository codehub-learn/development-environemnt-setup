## How to set up your PC

As mentioned above, we will need a working installation of Python. If you want you can use your system interpreter, but it is recommended to set this up in a virtual environment so that you don't mess up your system's dependencies. This can be either done through the IDE or manually. If you opt for the latter and are usure on how to set it up, you can read [this guide](https://realpython.com/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/) on how virtual environments work in Python.

This course will mostly be done partly on an IDE and partly on Jupyter Notebooks (for the more interactive parts like data analysis and visualization). The IDE we will use is PyCharm (you can [download the Community Edition for free](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download)), but it won't make much a difference if you want to follow along on any other IDE you feel more comfortable with (e.g. VS code).

Additionally for Integrating with an RDBMS we will use [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) as an example. If you want to fully follow along, please set this up also on your computer.
