## PostgreSQL 

For Windows x86-64, download the latest version of [PostgreSQL 14.4](https://www.enterprisedb.com/downloads/postgres-postgresql-downloads). This is free software and requires no registration.

Execute the postgresql-14.4-1-windows-x64.exe 

 
## Sample databases

Go to [this page](https://postgrespro.com/education/demodb) and download the following  database (they are free to download and use): 

- [AdventureWorksDW2012.bak](https://github.com/Microsoft/sql-server-samples/releases/download/adventureworks/AdventureWorksDW2012.bak)
- [AdventureWorks2017.bak](https://github.com/Microsoft/sql-server-samples/releases/download/adventureworks/AdventureWorks2017.bak)

Be careful with the database names, there are many databases available on that page with similar sounding names. Be sure that you have selected the right ones.

The installation of the databases in MSSQL Server will be shown in one of the course sessions.
