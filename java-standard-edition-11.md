# Hardware and software requirements for Java Standard Edition development (Java SE 11 or later)
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

## Workstation specifications
- Windows 10/11 or Linux or MacOS, 64 bit
- Minimum of 8GB RAM, 16GB preferable
- Minimum of 128 GB Storage (SSD would be preferrable)
- Minimum of 2-Core CPU

## Development IDE
**[Download IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=windows)** and install. In case you already have it installed and your license has expired, we will provide you a valid license for the duration of the course. In case you prefer using another IDE, that's also fine as the examples do not make use of any IDE specific functionality. 

## Java Development Tools
1. Java Development Toolkit: download and install Java 11 **[JDK 11](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk11-archive-downloads.html#license-lightbox)** (requires free account with Oracle). If you have Java 17 already installed, you do not need to install Java 11; use Java 17 instead.
2. Create an environmental variable named **JAVA_HOME** pointing to JDK installation folder.
3. Add **%JAVA_HOME%\bin** to your **PATH** envrionmental variable.

## Other tools
1. Download and install **[Git Version Control](https://git-scm.com/downloads)**. If you have an older version of git, it is recommended that you update to the latest version.
2. Create a **[Github account](https://github.com/join)** if you don't already have one (it is free).
