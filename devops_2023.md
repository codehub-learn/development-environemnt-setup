## Software Stack
1. Download and install **[Git Version Control](https://git-scm.com/downloads)**.
2. Download and install Java 11 or later (**[Java JDK 17](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#jdk17-windows)**).

5. Download and install **[PuTTY ssh client](https://www.putty.org/)**.
6. Download and install **[Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)**. Depending on your hardware on operating system, Docker might ask you to enable CPU virtualization support and install Windows Subsystem for Linux, WSL. All you need to do for these is to simply follow the instructions that Docker will give you.
7. Download and install **[Ansible](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html#installing-and-upgrading-ansible)**. Ansible requires any version of **[Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/)**, so make sure that you have installed Python first. Also, Ansible sets up its own Linux virtual machine, so for Windows you will need the **[Linux Subsystem for Windows (WSL)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)**, which was already installed with Docker in the previous step.
