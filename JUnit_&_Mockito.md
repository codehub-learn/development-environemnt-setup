# Software requirements for JUnit & Mockito

## Development IDE
**[Download IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=windows)** and install. In case you already have it installed and your license has expired, we will provide you a valid license for the duration of the course. In case you prefer using another IDE, that's also fine as the examples do not make use of any IDE specific functionality. 

## Java Development Tools
1. Download the .exe file and install the latest LTS version of **[Liberica JDK 17 LTS](https://bell-sw.com/pages/downloads/)**.

## Other tools
1. Download and install **[Git Version Control](https://git-scm.com/downloads)**.
2. Create a **[Github account](https://github.com/join)**.
