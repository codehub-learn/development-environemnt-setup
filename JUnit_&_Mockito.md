# Software requirements for JUnit & Mockito

## Development IDE
**[Download IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=windows)** and install it. 

Note: In case you prefer using another IDE, or you have a valid license for IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate, that's also fine, as the examples do not make use of any IDE specific functionality. 

## Java Development Tools
1. Download the .exe file and install the **latest** LTS version of **[Liberica JDK LTS](https://bell-sw.com/pages/downloads/)** (use only the LTS version, not the "Current" version).

## Other tools
1. Download and install **[Git Version Control](https://git-scm.com/downloads)**.
2. Create a **[Github account](https://github.com/join)**.
