# Hardware and software requirements for Java Standard Edition development (Java SE 17)
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

## Workstation specifications
- Windows 10 or Linux or MacOS, 64 bit
- RAM, 8GB required, 16GB preferable
- 128 GB Storage (SSD would be preferrable)
- 4 Core CPU

## Development IDE
**[Download IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=windows)** and install. In case you already have it installed and your license has expired, we will provide you a valid license for the duration of the course. In case you prefer using another IDE, that's also fine as the examples do not make use of any IDE specific functionality. 

## Java Development Tools
1. Java Development Toolkit, download and install the latest LTS version **[JDK 17](https://download.oracle.com/java/17/archive/jdk-17.0.5_windows-x64_bin.exe)**. Create then an environmental variable named **JAVA_HOME** pointing to JDK installation folder.
2. Maven, download **[Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)** and follow the **[instructions](https://maven.apache.org/install.html)**. Through Maven dependency management mechanism, we will download every library needed in our projects.  Create then an environmental variable named **MVN_HOME** pointing to Maven's installation folder.
3. Add **%JAVA_HOME%\bin** and **%MVN_HOME%\bin** to your **PATH** envrionmental variable.

## Other tools
1. Download and install **[Git Version Control](https://git-scm.com/downloads)**.
2. Create a **[Github account](https://github.com/join)**.
