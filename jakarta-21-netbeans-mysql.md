In case you prefer using another IDE, you are free to use it but the course will be delivered based on Eclipse. 

## Java Development Tools
1. We will need Java 21. See instructions here for **[Java version 21](https://github.com/codehub-learn/DOWNLOAD_INSTRUCTIONS_HERE_FROM_OUR_OWN_GITHUB_IF_EXISTS_WE_HAVE_VERSION_17_INSTRUCTIONS)** CREATE VERSION 21 FROM THIS https://github.com/codehub-learn/development-environment-setup/blob/main/java-standard-edition-17.md.
2. Maven will be installed by Netbeans. If you want to try it out independently of Netbeans, you can manually download and install from **[Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)** and follow the **[instructions](https://maven.apache.org/install.html)**. 
3. Create then an environmental variable named **MVN_HOME** pointing to Maven's installation folder.

## Database Tools
1. See the instructions for **[installing MySQL](https://github.com/codehub-learn/DOWNLOAD_INSTRUCTIONS_HERE_FROM_OUR_OWN_GITHUB_IF_EXISTS)** the MySQL Server and the WHATEVER_ELSE_TOOL_WE_WILL_NEED tool

## Application Server
1. Download the zip file with the latest version of **[WildFly](https://www.wildfly.org/downloads/)**. Create a folder in your system where the zip file will be unzipped. It does not require any installation.

## Other Tools
1. Download and install **[Git Version Control](https://git-scm.com/downloads)**.
2. Create a **[Github account](https://github.com/join)** if you do not already have one.
